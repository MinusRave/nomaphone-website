## Getting Started

<details>
<summary>Do I need any writing experience to use Bookify?</summary>

No. Bookify is built for subject matter experts, not professional writers. If you can describe what you want to teach or explain, Bookify handles the structure, articulation, and coherence. Many successful users have never written a book before.

The key skill you need: **knowledge of your topic.** Bookify turns expertise into structured content—it can't create expertise from nothing.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How long does it take to create a book?</summary>

**Your active time:** 5-10 minutes to set up (choose intent, write description, select proposal)

**Generation time:** 20-40 minutes for the full manuscript depending on chapter count

**Total:** Under an hour from idea to downloadable book, with most of that time being automated. You can leave and come back—generation continues in the background and you'll receive an email when complete.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What topics can Bookify handle?</summary>

Bookify works best for **educational, business, and informational content:**
- Marketing strategies and tactics
- Business frameworks and methodologies
- Technical skills and tutorials
- Professional development
- Health and wellness education
- How-to guides and training materials
- Industry reports and analysis

**Less suitable for:**
- Fiction and creative storytelling (try Sudowrite)
- Poetry or highly literary work
- Academic research papers requiring citations
- Legal or medical advice requiring professional review

When in doubt, generate a free proposal to see if the structure makes sense for your topic.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I create books in languages other than English?</summary>

Yes! Bookify generates books in **10 languages:** English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese.

The quality is consistent across all languages—we're not translating from English, we're generating natively in your chosen language using Claude Sonnet 4.5's multilingual capabilities. Credit costs are identical regardless of language.
</details>

## Credits & Pricing

<details>
<summary>How does the credit system work?</summary>

Bookify uses a simple model:
- **Free:** Generate unlimited book proposals (complete outlines with chapter summaries)
- **Paid:** Creating the full manuscript requires credits based on chapter count
- **Transparent:** You see exact credit cost before generating any book

Credits never expire. Buy what you need, use at your own pace. No subscriptions required unless you prefer automatic monthly credits.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What determines how many credits a book costs?</summary>

**Primary factor:** Number of chapters (complexity)

A 4-chapter lead magnet costs less than a 15-chapter comprehensive guide because it requires less AI processing and knowledge management work.

**Does NOT affect cost:**
- Final word count (varies naturally by topic)
- Language selected
- Number of times you export (PDF/DOCX/Markdown)
- Regenerating exports with updated metadata

The exact cost is shown before you click "Generate Book"—no surprises.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I get a refund if I don't like my book?</summary>

We don't offer refunds for successfully completed generations because the AI work has been done and credits have been consumed. However:

**You can validate before committing:**
- Proposals are completely free
- See the full chapter outline and structure before spending credits
- Review estimated word counts and generation approach
- Generate multiple proposals to find the right fit

**We DO refund if:**
- Generation fails due to a technical error on our end (automatic)
- You're charged incorrectly (contact support immediately)

If you're unsure about a topic, start with a small test book (4-6 chapters) before committing to larger projects.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do credits expire?</summary>

No. Credits remain in your account indefinitely. Whether you use them in a week or spread them over a year, they're always available when you need them.
</details>

## Book Quality & Editing

<details>
<summary>How good is the quality compared to human-written books?</summary>

**Honest answer:** Bookify produces high-quality first drafts with excellent structure and continuity. Most users find the content 80-90% ready to use immediately.

**What Bookify excels at:**
- Logical structure and flow
- Consistent terminology and depth
- Chapter continuity (later chapters reference earlier ones naturally)
- Comprehensive coverage of topics
- Professional formatting and organization

**Where human editing adds value:**
- Adding personal stories and unique examples
- Fine-tuning tone to match your exact voice
- Including proprietary frameworks or methodologies
- Adding industry-specific nuances
- Personalizing calls-to-action

Many users follow this workflow: Generate with Bookify (20-40 min) → Edit for voice and examples (30-60 min) → Publish. This is still 10-20x faster than writing from scratch.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I edit the content after generation?</summary>

Absolutely. Export to **DOCX** (Word format) or **Markdown** and edit in any tool you prefer:
- Microsoft Word
- Google Docs
- Notion
- Obsidian
- Any text editor

The files are fully editable with proper heading structure, formatting, and metadata. Many users treat Bookify as a "structure and draft" tool, then personalize the content before publishing.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What if the generated book doesn't match my vision?</summary>

If the book doesn't align with your expectations:

1. **Check your proposal selection:** Did you pick the structure that best matched your goals? Sometimes a different proposal from the initial three is a better fit.

2. **Regenerate with more detail:** Proposals are free. Add more specificity to your book description (specific topics to cover, frameworks to include, audience details) and generate new proposals.

3. **Choose a different intent:** If you selected "Lead Magnet" but wanted comprehensive depth, try "Digital Product" or "General" instead. Intent drives structure significantly.

4. **Edit the export:** Sometimes it's faster to generate then edit specific chapters rather than regenerate entirely.

Since proposals are free, iterate until you find the right approach before spending credits.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does Bookify plagiarize or copy existing content?</summary>

No. Bookify generates original content based on your description and chosen structure. It's powered by Claude Sonnet 4.5, which creates new text rather than copying existing sources.

**That said:**
- AI-generated content may reflect common knowledge, frameworks, or explanations similar to existing published material
- For proprietary methodologies or unique approaches, include them explicitly in your book description
- Always review content for accuracy and add your own examples, case studies, and personal insights

We recommend treating AI-generated content as a strong first draft that benefits from your expertise and personalization.
</details>

## Book Generation Process

<details>
<summary>Can I pause or stop generation once it starts?</summary>

You can stop generation, but you'll lose the work completed and the credits spent. There's no "pause and resume" feature currently.

**Better approach:** Let generation complete (it continues in the background even if you close your browser), then edit the exported DOCX to make changes. Future updates will include chapter-level regeneration.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if generation fails or gets stuck?</summary>

If generation fails due to a technical error:
1. You're automatically refunded credits for incomplete work
2. An error notification appears in your dashboard
3. Support is notified automatically

This is rare—our success rate is over 99%. If it happens, [contact support](/help/contact/) and we'll investigate immediately.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I generate multiple books at the same time?</summary>

Yes, but each generation runs sequentially. If you start a second book while one is generating, the second enters a queue and begins after the first completes. This ensures quality and prevents resource conflicts.

For most users, generating one book at a time is sufficient since active time is only 5-10 minutes per book.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Will I get an email when my book is ready?</summary>

Yes. When generation completes, you receive an email with:
- Confirmation that your book is ready
- Direct link to view and download it
- Quick stats (chapter count, word count, generation time)

You can also check progress anytime from your dashboard without waiting for the email.
</details>

## Export & Formatting

<details>
<summary>What file formats can I export to?</summary>

Three formats, all generated on-demand:

**PDF** – Professional, print-ready format with:
- Formatted title page with metadata
- Automatic table of contents
- Proper pagination and headers
- Ready for distribution or printing

**DOCX** – Fully editable in:
- Microsoft Word
- Google Docs
- LibreOffice
- Any compatible word processor

**Markdown** – Plain text with formatting tags, perfect for:
- Web publishing
- Conversion to other formats
- Version control (Git)
- Technical documentation workflows

All exports include your metadata (author, copyright, edition) and maintain structure.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I regenerate exports if I update metadata?</summary>

Yes, and it's free. Change your author name, copyright year, or edition number anytime, then regenerate any format. You're not charged again—exports are unlimited once the book exists.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Are the PDFs print-ready?</summary>

Yes. Bookify PDFs use professional typesetting with:
- Proper margins and pagination
- Consistent font hierarchy
- Table of contents with page numbers
- Title page with metadata

You can send them directly to print services or publish digitally without additional formatting.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I customize the PDF design (fonts, colors, layout)?</summary>

Not currently. PDFs use our standard professional template optimized for readability. 

For custom design:
1. Export to DOCX
2. Apply your custom template in Word or InDesign
3. Export to PDF with your preferred styling

We may add template options in future updates based on user demand.
</details>

## Use Cases & Best Practices

<details>
<summary>What's the difference between Lead Magnet and Digital Product intents?</summary>

**Lead Magnet** is optimized for **conversion and lead generation:**
- Shorter (4-8 chapters typically)
- Quick, actionable content
- Scannable formatting
- Immediate value and tactical wins
- Natural CTAs to next steps

**Digital Product** is optimized for **monetization and comprehensive value:**
- Longer (10-15 chapters)
- Framework-driven depth
- Case studies and real-world examples
- Implementation guides
- Professional completeness that justifies purchase price

Use Lead Magnet for free giveaways to grow your list. Use Digital Product for paid info products on Gumroad, your site, or marketplaces.

<details>
<summary>Can I use Bookify books to sell on Amazon KDP?</summary>

Yes, with important caveats:

**You CAN:**
- Use Bookify to generate manuscript content
- Edit and personalize the content
- Format it for KDP requirements
- Publish under your name/brand

**You SHOULD:**
- Thoroughly edit and personalize the content
- Add unique examples, case studies, and insights

Amazon requires books to provide unique value. Use Bookify as the foundation, then enhance with your expertise and personalization.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Is there a limit to how many books I can create?</summary>

No limit on the number of books—only on your available credits. Create as many books as you need, whenever you need them.

Your dashboard stores all generated books indefinitely, so you can access past manuscripts and regenerate exports anytime.
