**Not every book fits a category.** Sometimes you need a manifesto, a research report, internal documentation, or a creative exploration. Bookify's General Engine gives you complete flexibility—create any type of book without intent-specific constraints.

## When to Use the General Engine

Choose General when your book doesn't fit the other three intents:

❌ **Not a lead magnet** (not focused on conversion)  
❌ **Not a digital product** (not primarily for monetization)  
❌ **Not course material** (not pedagogically structured for learning)

✅ **But still valuable, important, and worth creating**

### Projects That Fit General Intent

**Company manifestos and vision documents**  
Your company's philosophy, values, or strategic vision articulated in long form. Think Apple's "Think Different" or Patagonia's environmental mission—but in book format.

**Industry reports and white papers**  
Research findings, market analysis, trend reports, or technical investigations that require depth and structure.

**Internal documentation and handbooks**  
Employee guides, process documentation, organizational knowledge that doesn't fit traditional training material format.

**Thought leadership and opinion pieces**  
Essays and perspectives that establish your point of view on industry topics, bundled into a cohesive narrative.

**Creative non-fiction**  
Personal essays, travel narratives, memoirs, or explorations that don't fit standard educational formats.

**Resource compilations**  
Curated collections of frameworks, tools, case studies, or resources organized thematically.

## What You'll Get with the General Engine

### Adaptable Structure (Any Length)

Unlike other intents with optimal ranges, General accommodates:

**Short books (4-6 chapters):** Focused manifestos or position papers  
**Medium books (8-12 chapters):** Standard guides or reports  
**Long books (15-20+ chapters):** Comprehensive documentation or deep explorations

You determine the appropriate length—the engine adapts.

### Balanced Tone and Approach

General Engine doesn't optimize for:
- Conversion tactics (like Lead Magnet)
- Monetization positioning (like Digital Product)
- Pedagogical scaffolding (like Course Material)

Instead, it provides:
- **Neutral, professional tone** adaptable to any context
- **Logical flow** without predetermined structure
- **Flexibility** to emphasize what matters for your specific purpose

You maintain full creative control over angle and emphasis.

### No Constraints or Assumptions

Other intents make smart assumptions (Lead Magnets should be scannable, Course Materials need exercises). General makes none.

**This means:**
- Chapters can be any length (500 words to 5,000 words)
- Depth can vary (some chapters conceptual, others tactical)
- Style is entirely customizable (formal, casual, technical, narrative)
- Purpose is whatever you define it to be

Maximum flexibility = maximum responsibility for clear direction.

## Real Use Cases from General Engine

### Company Culture Handbook

**Context:** Startup with 50 employees needed a culture guide explaining values, decision-making philosophy, and working principles.

**Approach:** Used General engine to create "How We Work: [Company] Operating Principles" in 35 minutes. 10 chapters covering values, communication norms, decision-making frameworks, and conflict resolution.

**Outcome:** New hires onboard with clear cultural expectations. Reduced "this isn't how things work here" friction by 60%.

### Industry Trend Report

**Context:** Marketing agency wanted to publish an authoritative report on "The Future of B2B Content Marketing: 2025-2030 Predictions."

**Approach:** Generated 12-chapter report in 38 minutes covering AI impact, channel evolution, measurement changes, and strategic recommendations. Added proprietary survey data during editing.

**Outcome:** 2,400 downloads. Generated 47 inbound leads. Positioned agency as thought leaders.

### Personal Manifesto / Book of Principles

**Context:** Entrepreneur wanted to codify personal operating principles and decision-making frameworks to share with team and family.

**Approach:** Created "The [Name] Playbook: How I Think About Work and Life" in 32 minutes. 8 chapters on values, decision frameworks, time philosophy, and relationship principles.

**Outcome:** Clarity for team on how founder makes decisions. Reference document for important choices. Gift to children explaining life philosophy.

### Technical Documentation

**Context:** Software company needed comprehensive API documentation that was readable, not just reference material.

**Approach:** Generated "Developer Guide: [Product] API Integration" in 40 minutes. 15 chapters progressing from authentication to advanced use cases.

**Outcome:** Support tickets decreased 30%. Developer onboarding time reduced from 2 days to 4 hours. Better developer experience.

## How to Use the General Engine Effectively

### Step 1: Define Your Purpose Explicitly

Without intent-specific guardrails, you must be crystal clear about purpose:

**Ask yourself:**
- Who is the primary audience?
- What should they be able to do or understand after reading?
- What tone and style are appropriate?
- How deep should the coverage be?

**Write this in your book description** so the AI understands your goals.

### Step 2: Specify Structure Preferences

General Engine won't assume structure—you define it.

**Include in your description:**

**Organizational logic:**
- "Structured chronologically" (events in time order)
- "Organized thematically" (grouped by topic)
- "Progressive complexity" (simple to advanced)
- "Problem-solution format" (issue then resolution)

**Emphasis distribution:**
- "Equal weight to all sections"
- "First half foundational, second half applied"
- "Heavy focus on Chapters 5-8, others supportive"

**Tone and formality:**
- "Professional and formal" (corporate reports)
- "Conversational and accessible" (thought leadership)
- "Technical and precise" (documentation)
- "Personal and reflective" (manifestos)

The more specific your direction, the better the output.

### Step 3: Choose Appropriate Chapter Count

**Guidelines by purpose:**

**Manifestos/Vision documents:** 5-8 chapters (focused message)  
**Reports/Analysis:** 8-12 chapters (comprehensive but digestible)  
**Documentation:** 12-20 chapters (complete coverage)  
**Thought leadership:** 10-15 chapters (depth without bloat)

When in doubt, err on the side of more chapters—easier to consolidate than expand.

### Step 4: Review Proposals for Fit

Bookify generates three outlines. Evaluate based on **your unique criteria**:

**Does the structure match your intended use?**  
**Is the tone appropriate for your audience?**  
**Does the progression make sense for your purpose?**

Because General has no preset optimization, **you're the final judge** of what works.

### Step 5: Heavy Customization Expected

General Engine creates the structure and articulates concepts, but **expects significant editing:**

- Add domain-specific terminology and examples
- Insert proprietary frameworks or methodologies
- Adjust tone to match your brand or voice
- Reorganize sections if needed
- Add or remove content based on purpose

Think of it as **a comprehensive first draft** rather than a finished product.

## Strengths and Limitations of General Engine

### Where General Excels

✅ **Unique projects** that don't fit standard categories  
✅ **Custom structures** not well-served by preset optimization  
✅ **Experimental formats** or new content types  
✅ **Multi-purpose books** serving several goals simultaneously  
✅ **Highly specialized content** requiring domain expertise

### Where Other Intents Are Better

If your book's primary purpose is:

**Lead generation** → Use Lead Magnet Engine (conversion-optimized)  
**Revenue generation** → Use Digital Product Engine (value-positioned)  
**Skill development** → Use Course Material Engine (pedagogically structured)

General works for these too, but you'll do more editing to achieve the same optimization.

### The Flexibility Trade-off

**More flexibility = more responsibility.**

Other engines give you smart defaults and proven patterns. General gives you a blank canvas. This is powerful for experienced creators who know exactly what they want, but potentially overwhelming for first-time book creators.

**Recommendation:** If you're new to Bookify, start with one of the specialized intents (even if imperfect fit). Learn how structure impacts quality. Then use General for projects requiring custom approaches.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>When should I use General instead of the other three intents?</summary>

Use General when your book doesn't primarily serve lead generation, monetization, or structured learning. Examples: company vision documents, research reports, technical documentation, manifestos, personal projects. If your book has a clear marketing, sales, or educational purpose, the specialized intents will give better results with less editing.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does General Engine produce lower quality books?</summary>

No—it produces different structure. General doesn't include intent-specific optimizations (scannability for lead magnets, framework emphasis for products, scaffolding for courses), but that's only relevant if you need those features. For projects requiring custom structure, General is actually better because it's not constrained by preset patterns.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I switch intents mid-project?</summary>

Not mid-generation, but you can regenerate. If you start with General and realize Lead Magnet would work better, create a new proposal with Lead Magnet intent. Proposals are free, so experiment with different intents to see which structure fits best before generating.
