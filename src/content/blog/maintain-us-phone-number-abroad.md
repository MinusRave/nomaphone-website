You're moving to Portugal for a year. Or Thailand for six months. Or you're already abroad and realize you need your US phone number for banking, 2FA codes, job applications, and staying connected.

The problem: US carriers charge $50-100 per month for international plans. And if you cancel, you lose your number forever.

There are better options. Here's how to keep your US number active while living abroad without paying carrier rates.

## Why You Need to Keep Your US Number

Before we get to solutions, understand what you'll lose without a US number:

### Banking and Finance
- 2FA codes from banks (Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo)
- Fraud alerts via SMS
- Credit card verification
- Brokerage accounts (Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard)
- PayPal, Venmo, Cash App verification

### Professional
- LinkedIn verification
- Job applications (US employers expect US number)
- Professional networking
- Freelance platform verification (Upwork, Fiverr)

### Government and Legal
- IRS correspondence
- Social Security Administration
- USCIS (if applicable)
- State DMV notifications
- Voter registration in some states

### Services and Accounts
- Amazon, Netflix, streaming services
- Google, Apple, Microsoft accounts
- Uber, Lyft, DoorDash
- Hotels, airlines, loyalty programs
- Pretty much any US-based service

**Reality:** Nearly impossible to maintain US financial and digital life without US phone number.

## Option 1: Google Voice (Best for Most People)

**Cost:** Free
**Setup time:** 30 minutes
**Difficulty:** Easy (if done before leaving US)

### How It Works
Google Voice gives you a US phone number that forwards to any phone worldwide. You keep your number, receive calls and texts, and it costs nothing.

### Requirements
- US phone number to set up initially (can port your existing number)
- US IP address during setup (or VPN)
- Gmail account

### What You Get
- Real US phone number (your choice of area code)
- Receive SMS/calls anywhere
- Make free calls to US/Canada
- Voicemail transcription
- Works on any device (web, iOS, Android)

### Limitations
- Must set up while in US (or with US number and VPN)
- Some banks/services block VoIP numbers for verification
- Call quality varies internationally
- Can't port to another carrier later (you're locked in)
- Google can suspend account (rare but happens)

### Setup Process
**Before Leaving US:**
1. Go to voice.google.com
2. Click "Get Google Voice"
3. Choose US number (pick area code)
4. Verify with your current US number
5. Choose: Keep both numbers or port your existing number
6. Port costs $20 if moving your current number to Google Voice
7. Takes 24 hours to complete port

**If Already Abroad:**
1. Need someone in US to help (friend/family)
2. Use their US number for initial verification
3. Or use VPN + temporary US number service
4. More complicated but possible

### Making It Work Abroad
- Calls: Free to US/Canada via Google Voice app or web
- SMS: Receive on Google Voice app
- Give this as your "US number" for all services
- Keep your foreign SIM for local calls/data

### Costs
- Setup: $0-20 (free if new number, $20 to port existing)
- Monthly: $0
- US calls: $0
- International calls: $0.01-0.20 per minute

**Best for:** US citizens leaving temporarily (1-3 years) who have US number to start with.

## Option 2: Keep Your Current Carrier (Expensive but Simple)

**Cost:** $50-100+ per month
**Setup time:** 5 minutes (call carrier)
**Difficulty:** Easy

### The Plans

**T-Mobile International**
- $50/month base plan
- $15/month international add-on
- Unlimited data (slow speeds)
- Calls: Additional charges
- **Total: $65+/month**

**AT&T International Day Pass**
- $35+/month base plan
- $10 per day you use phone abroad
- Full speed data those days
- **Total: Varies, expensive if using often**

**Verizon TravelPass**
- $35+/month base plan
- $10 per day you use phone
- 500MB high-speed data per day
- **Total: $10/day adds up fast**

### The Math
If you're abroad 6 months and use your phone 15 days per month:
- AT&T/Verizon: $35 base + $150 (15 days) = $185/month
- Over 6 months: $1,110
- **Google Voice same period: $0**

### When This Makes Sense
- Short trips (under 1 month)
- You need everything to "just work"
- Company pays for it
- You're returning to US frequently

**Best for:** Short-term travelers or people with unlimited budget.

## Option 3: Minimal Carrier Plan + Google Voice

**Cost:** $15-30 per month
**Setup time:** 1 hour
**Difficulty:** Medium

### The Strategy
Keep your carrier on cheapest possible plan just to maintain number, but forward everything to Google Voice for actual use.

### Cheapest Carrier Plans

**T-Mobile Connect**
- $10/month (500MB data) or $15/month (3GB)
- Keeps your number active
- Use only for maintaining account

**AT&T Prepaid**
- $25/month minimum
- Can pause occasionally

**Mint Mobile**
- $15/month (4GB)
- T-Mobile network
- Good for maintaining number

**US Mobile**
- $18/month (2GB)
- Can customize plan

### How to Set It Up
1. Downgrade carrier plan to cheapest option
2. Set up Google Voice with new number
3. Forward all calls/texts from carrier to Google Voice
4. Update all services with Google Voice number
5. Keep carrier SIM in drawer, use only to receive port verification codes if needed

### Why Do This
- Keeps your original number "alive"
- Can port back to regular carrier if returning to US
- Google Voice can't be ported out (you're not locked in same way)
- Some banks require traditional carrier number

**Best for:** People planning to return to US who want flexibility.

## Option 4: Virtual US Number Services

**Cost:** $2-15 per month
**Setup time:** 15 minutes
**Difficulty:** Easy

### Popular Services

**OpenPhone**
- $15/month
- Business-focused features
- Good for professional use
- Can receive calls/SMS

**Tossable Digits**
- $5-10/month
- Multiple numbers available
- Quick setup

**Hushed**
- $4-8/month

**Burner**
- $5/month
- Temporary numbers
- Good for testing

### Limitations
These are VoIP numbers. Many services block them:
- Banks often reject for verification
- Government sites may not accept
- Not seen as "real" phone numbers
- Can't port out to carrier

### When Virtual Numbers Work
- Professional separate line
- Business calling number
- Privacy for online purchases
- Secondary verification method
- Don't need bank acceptance

**Best for:** Additional numbers, business use, not as primary US identity number.

## Option 5: US Mobile MVNO Plans

**Cost:** $10-25 per month
**Setup time:** 20 minutes
**Difficulty:** Easy

### What MVNOs Are
Mobile Virtual Network Operators use major carrier networks (T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon) but charge less.

### Good Options for Expats

**Tello (T-Mobile network)**
- $10/month unlimited text + 500MB data
- Keep number active
- Can receive SMS internationally

**Ultra Mobile**
- $15/month
- Specifically designed for international users
- Free international calling to some countries

**Red Pocket**
- $15/month
- Flexible plans
- Multiple network options

### How This Works
1. Order SIM online (shipped to US address)
2. Activate with US number
3. Keep SIM in drawer or in dual-SIM phone
4. Maintain number for under $20/month
5. Receive SMS via WiFi calling or when SIM inserted

**Best for:** People who want traditional carrier number without carrier prices.

## Option 6: Port to VoIP Service

**Cost:** $2-5 per month
**Setup time:** 3-5 days
**Difficulty:** Medium

### Services That Accept Ports

**MySudo**
- $0.99/month per number

- Can receive SMS

**Numberbarn**
- $2-5/month depending on features

### Porting Process

2. Request port from new service
3. They contact your carrier
3. Takes 3-5 business days
4. Your carrier charges final bill

### Advantages
- Cheaper than carrier
- Keep your actual number
- More flexible than Google Voice
- Can port out later if needed

### Disadvantages
- Porting takes time (do before leaving US)
- Some services have poor quality
- May not work with all banks

**Best for:** People committed to being abroad long-term who want cheapest option.

## What Banks Accept

Testing with major US banks:

### Accept Google Voice
- Capital One (usually)
- Discover
- Some credit unions
- PayPal (sometimes)

### Reject Google Voice
- Chase (inconsistent)
- Bank of America (blocks VoIP)
- Wells Fargo (blocks VoIP)
- Citibank (blocks VoIP)
- Most major banks (safer to avoid)

### Accept Traditional Carrier/MVNO
- All major banks
- All credit cards
- All financial institutions

**Key insight:** For banking, traditional carrier or MVNO better than Google Voice or virtual numbers.

## Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

Most expats end up with combination:

**Setup:**
1. Keep minimal carrier or MVNO plan ($15-25/month)
2. Use carrier number for banking, government, important services
3. Set up Google Voice for everything else
4. Give Google Voice to friends, job applications, general use
5. Keep carrier number for critical services only

**Why this works:**
- Banks happy with real carrier number
- Most communication free via Google Voice
- Reasonable monthly cost
- Flexibility to return to US easily

## Avoiding Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Canceling Carrier Too Soon
If you cancel carrier without porting number somewhere, you lose it forever. Can't get it back.

**Solution:** Port to Google Voice or another service BEFORE canceling carrier.

### Mistake 2: Not Testing from Abroad
Many services say they work internationally but don't. Test everything before you need it.

**Solution:** Make test calls/texts after moving abroad. Verify before emergency.

### Mistake 3: Only Using VoIP for Banking
Bank eventually asks you to verify by calling from your number. VoIP numbers often fail.

**Solution:** Keep one traditional carrier/MVNO number for financial services.

### Mistake 4: Forgetting to Update Contacts
You port to Google Voice but clients still have your old carrier number.

**Solution:** Send update to important contacts. Set voicemail on old number explaining new number.

### Mistake 5: Not Having Backup
Google Voice goes down. Services have outages. Bank needs to call you urgently.

**Solution:** Have two methods. Primary + backup. Never rely on single solution.

## Tax and Legal Considerations

### Maintaining US Address
Most services require US address. Use:
- Family member address
- Mail forwarding service
- Virtual mailbox service

### Voter Registration
Some states require US phone number for registration. Check your state requirements.

### State Residency
Maintaining phone number doesn't determine tax residency. That's separate issue. Consult tax professional.

## Special Situations

### Moving to Country with Local Number Requirements
Some countries (Germany, Japan) require local number for residence permit.

**Solution:** Get local number for legal requirements, keep US number for US services.

### Banking While Abroad
Banks may lock account if they see foreign logins without US number.

**Solution:** Keep US number active, use VPN when accessing bank websites.

### Returning to US Temporarily
If visiting US multiple times per year, regular carrier plan might make sense despite cost.

**Solution:** Calculate break-even. If in US more than 5-7 days per month, carrier plan cheaper than daily passes.

## Setup Timeline

**8 Weeks Before Leaving US:**
- Research options
- Decide on primary method
- Set up Google Voice if using it

**4 Weeks Before:**
- Port number if going that route
- Test services with banking
- Update important contacts

**2 Weeks Before:**
- Verify everything works
- Set up forwarding
- Download apps needed

**Departure Day:**
- Confirm you can receive texts
- Test one call to verify
- Have backup plan ready

**First Week Abroad:**
- Test all services from new location
- Verify SMS reception works
- Make adjustments if needed

## Monthly Cost Comparison (Annual)

**Just Google Voice:**
- Year 1: $20 (setup) = $20 total
- Subsequent years: $0
- 5-year total: $20

**Keep Regular Carrier:**
- $65/month × 12 = $780/year
- 5-year total: $3,900

**Minimal Carrier + Google Voice:**
- $20/month × 12 = $240/year
- 5-year total: $1,200

**MVNO:**
- $15/month × 12 = $180/year
- 5-year total: $900

For someone abroad 5 years, choosing right solution saves $3,000-3,800.

## The Bottom Line

**For most people abroad 6+ months:**
1. Set up Google Voice before leaving (free US calls/texts)
2. Keep minimal MVNO plan ($10-15/month) for banking
3. Use Google Voice for everything non-banking
4. Total cost: $10-15/month vs $50-100+ on carrier

**For short trips (under 3 months):**
Keep regular carrier, accept the cost for simplicity.

**For permanent expats:**
Port to VoIP service ($2-5/month) or just use Google Voice ($0).

**For maximum reliability:**
Minimal carrier ($15/month) + Google Voice (free) = two numbers, maximum compatibility.

The key is not losing your number. Once it's gone, you can't get the same number back. Set up your solution before canceling anything.
