"How much does it cost to call internationally?" seems like a simple question. The answer is anything but simple.

Call Mexico from the US: could be free, $0.01/minute, $0.03/minute, $0.50/minute, or $2.00/minute depending on which method you use.

This guide breaks down actual costs for calling 50+ countries using different methods in 2025.

## The Three Pricing Tiers

- Eastern Europe
- Latin America (most)
- Asia (most)
- Middle East (major countries)

## Money-Saving Strategies

### 1. Know the Number Type

### 2. Use Apps When Possible
If recipient has WhatsApp, use it. Free for both parties.

### 3. Schedule Calls
If you control timing, call during off-peak hours (some services offer lower rates).

### 4. Buy Credits in Bulk
Services offering packages often give bonuses:
- $50 package: Get $55 in credits
- $100 package: Get $115 in credits

### 5. Use Right Service for Destination
- US/Canada: Google Voice (free)
- Everywhere else: Browser calling ($0.01-0.20/min)
- Never use carrier roaming unless emergency

### 6. Get Virtual Number
If you call one country frequently, get virtual number there. Recipients call you at local rates.
- US virtual number: $2.19/month
- UK virtual number: $1.90/month
- Worth it if receive 3+ calls/month
