If you relied on Skype to call family abroad, contact clients internationally, or reach your bank's customer service line, you've probably noticed something: **Skype calling is gone.**

In May 2025, Microsoft officially discontinued Skype's dial pad feature for calling traditional phone numbers. While you can still use Skype for video calls between app users, the ability to call landlines and mobile numbers—the feature millions depended on—is dead.

For digital nomads working from Thailand, expats managing property in their home country, or remote teams spread across continents, this isn't just inconvenient. It's a crisis.

The good news? Better alternatives exist. This guide reveals the 7 best Skype replacements for international calling in 2025, with honest pros and cons for each.

## Why Skype Shut Down (And Why It Matters)

Microsoft didn't provide a detailed explanation, but the writing was on the wall. Skype struggled to compete with modern VoIP solutions like WhatsApp, Zoom, and browser-based calling platforms.

**The problem with Skype's shutdown:**
- 15+ years of users suddenly scrambling for alternatives
- No direct migration path to another service
- Remaining Skype credit became worthless
- Landline calling—critical for banks, government offices, and businesses—stopped working

If you're reading this, you're probably one of those scrambling users. Let's fix that.

## What You Actually Need in a Skype Alternative

Not all international calling services are created equal. Based on our experience (and feedback from hundreds of digital nomads), here's what matters:

**Must-have features:**
- **Calls to landlines and mobile numbers** (not just app-to-app)
- **No geo-restrictions** (works from Bali, Lisbon, or anywhere)
- **Transparent pricing** (no hidden fees or surprise charges)
- **Reliable audio quality** (for important calls to banks, clients, lawyers)
- **Easy setup** (you need to call NOW, not after a 3-day verification process)

**Nice-to-have features:**
- Virtual phone numbers (for receiving calls/SMS)
- SMS/2FA support (critical for banking while traveling)
- Team features (if you have a distributed team)
- No subscriptions (pay only for what you use)

Now let's compare the alternatives.

## The 7 Best Skype Alternatives for 2025

### 1. NomaPhone - Best for Digital Nomads

- Credits never expire

**Why it's #1 for nomads:**
- Works anywhere you have internet (no geo-restrictions like Google Voice)

- 30 seconds from landing page to first call
- Built by a telecommunications engineer who lived the nomad life
- Transparent pricing (no hidden fees)

### 2. Google Voice - Best for US Residents Only

**What it is:** Google's VoIP service with free US/Canada calling.

### 6. Zoom Phone - Best for Business Teams

**Pricing:** $15-20/user/month

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature | NomaPhone | Google Voice | Rebtel | Viber Out | WhatsApp |
|---------|-----------|--------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Browser-based** | ✓ | Partial | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| **No geo-restrictions** | ✓ | ✗ (US only) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Calls landlines** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| **SMS/2FA** | ✓ | ✓ | Limited | ✓ | ✗ |
| **No subscription** | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **USA rate** | $0.03/min | FREE* | Varies | $0.019/min | FREE** |
| **Virtual numbers** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |

*Free only for US residents  
**Free only app-to-app, can't call landlines

## Real-World Scenario: Why Browser-Based Wins

**Meet Sarah, a digital nomad working from Lisbon.**

She needs to call her accountant in New York about her tax returns. The accountant's office only has a landline.

**WhatsApp:** Can't call landlines. ✗

**Google Voice:** She's British, not American. Can't sign up. ✗

**Rebtel app:** Not installed on her current laptop. Would need to download, verify, add payment info. 20+ minutes. ✗

**NomaPhone:** Opens browser, enters email, calls in 30 seconds. ✓

This is why browser-based calling matters. No apps to manage, no verification hoops, no geo-restrictions.

## How to Choose the Right Alternative for You

**Choose Google Voice if:**
- You're a US resident
- You primarily call within US/Canada
- You're okay with app-based calling

**Choose Rebtel if:**
- You call one country daily (parents, partner, etc.)
- Unlimited plans make sense for your usage
- You don't mind app installations

**Choose NomaPhone if:**
- You're a digital nomad or expat
- You need to call landlines (banks, offices, government)
- You want browser-based convenience
- You call multiple countries occasionally
- You need SMS/2FA for banking abroad

**Choose Viber Out if:**
- You already use Viber for messaging
- Occasional landline calls only

## The Cost Reality: What You'll Actually Pay

Let's compare a realistic scenario: **Calling USA from Thailand, 100 minutes/month**

| Service | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| **International roaming** | $150-300 | $1.50-3/min typical rate |
| **Google Voice** | Can't use | Not available outside US |
| **NomaPhone** | $3 | $0.03/min × 100 min |
| **Rebtel unlimited** | $12 | If you max out the plan |
| **Viber Out** | $1.90 | $0.019/min × 100 min |

**Winner:** Viber Out is cheapest by cents, but NomaPhone wins on convenience (no app) and reliability (carrier-grade quality).

## What Happens to Your Skype Credit?

If you had Skype credit when the service shut down, you have two options:

1. **Use it in Microsoft Teams** (if you have Teams Free)
2. **Request a refund** through Microsoft support

Microsoft extended the ability to use Skype credits through Teams Free until the balance runs out, but you can't add more credit. Once it's gone, it's gone.

## Setting Up Your Skype Alternative in 5 Minutes

**Here's how to switch from Skype to NomaPhone:**

1. **Join the waitlist** at nomaphone.com
2. **Get your $10 beta credits** (first 50 signups get $10 total value)
3. **Open your browser** when NomaPhone launches (Q1 2026)
4. **Enter email and start calling** - no verification, no wait

**In the meantime:**
- Export your Skype contacts (if you still have access)
- Document important international numbers
- Test your internet connection quality

## The Future of International Calling

Skype's shutdown signals a broader shift. The future of international calling is:

**Browser-based** (no apps to manage)  
**Transparent** (clear pricing, no hidden fees)  
**Flexible** (pay-per-use, not subscriptions)  
**Accessible** (works from anywhere)  

This is exactly what NomaPhone is built for.

## Common Questions About Skype Alternatives

**Q: Can I port my Skype number to another service?**  
A: No. Skype numbers are proprietary and can't be ported. You'll need a new number with your alternative service.

**Q: What if I need to call emergency services?**  
A: VoIP services (including all Skype alternatives) are NOT for emergency calls. Always use your local mobile carrier for 911/112/999.

**Q: Do these services work on hotel/cafe WiFi?**  
A: Yes, but quality depends on connection strength. NomaPhone and other browser-based services generally perform better than apps on restricted networks.

**Q: Can I receive calls with these services?**  
A: Most services offer virtual phone numbers for receiving calls. NomaPhone includes virtual numbers for USA, UK, India, and other major countries.

## Take Action: Don't Wait for Another Service to Shut Down

Skype's shutdown taught us one lesson: **relying on a single provider is risky.**

The best time to find a Skype alternative was before it shut down. The second best time is now.

**Next steps:**

1. Choose your alternative based on your situation (see comparison above)
2. Test it with a low-stakes call first
3. Migrate your important contacts
4. Delete Skype (RIP)

If you're a digital nomad, expat, or remote worker who needs reliable international calling that works from anywhere, [join the NomaPhone waitlist](/) and get early access plus $10 in bonus credits.

No app required. No geo-restrictions. No BS.
