International calling from the UK changed after Brexit. The "Roam Like at Home" benefits disappeared for EU travel. Calling rates shifted. The landscape is different in 2025.

Whether you're calling the EU, USA, India, or anywhere else from the UK, here's what you need to know.

## How Brexit Changed International Calling

### What Changed on January 1, 2021

**Before Brexit:**
- UK was part of EU roaming agreement
- "Roam Like at Home" - use your UK plan in EU countries at no extra cost
- Free calls and data in France, Spain, Germany, Italy, etc.

**After Brexit:**
- UK no longer automatically part of roaming agreement
- Each UK carrier makes own deals with EU carriers

### Current State (2025)

**Good news:** Most major UK carriers still include EU roaming

## Brexit-Specific Tips

### Traveling to EU

**Before you go:**
1. Check YOUR plan's EU roaming policy
2. Don't assume it's included (even in 2025)
3. Some carriers charge £2-6/day
4. Fair use caps apply (usually 25GB data)

**While in EU:**
1. Your UK number still works
2. Calling UK from EU usually included
3. Calling OTHER EU countries might cost extra
4. Use WiFi calling when possible

**Alternatives:**
1. Buy local EU SIM if staying long term
2. Use browser calling over WiFi
3. WhatsApp for personal calls

### Calling EU Numbers from UK

Post-Brexit, calling EU numbers from UK is "international calling" - it costs money.

**Options:**
1. Browser calling (cheapest)
2. Carrier international add-on
3. WhatsApp (free but limited)

### EU Numbers Calling You

If someone in EU calls your UK mobile while you're in UK:
- They pay international rates (their problem)
- You don't pay to receive (usually)
- Works like any international call

## Recommended UK Setup

**For most UK residents:**

**Domestic/UK calling:**
- Regular UK mobile plan (plenty include unlimited UK calls)

**International calling:**
- Primary: Browser calling (affordable, reliable)
- Free option: WhatsApp when possible
- Emergency: Carrier direct (expensive but works)

**EU travel (if you do it):**
- Check your plan includes EU roaming
- If not, consider Three UK (most generous)
- Or use browser calling + local SIM

**Cost:**
- UK mobile plan: £10-30/month (standard)
- International calling: £5-20/month depending on usage
- Total: £15-50/month for everything

## Common UK-Specific Questions

### "Do I still get EU roaming?"

**Depends on your carrier and plan.** Most major carriers still include it as of 2025, but:
- Fair use limits apply (25GB typically)
- Could change in future (no guarantee)
- Check YOUR specific plan

### "Can I call EU numbers from UK for free?"

**No.** Even if your plan includes EU roaming, calling EU numbers FROM UK costs international rates.

### "What about calling Northern Ireland?"

**From Great Britain:** It's a UK domestic call (usually free on your plan)

**From Republic of Ireland:** It's an international call

**It's complicated:** Post-Brexit logistics

### "Are there Brexit-proof calling methods?"

**Yes:** Browser calling doesn't care about Brexit. Works the same whether calling EU, US, or anywhere else.

### "Will roaming charges come back?"

**Unknown.** Carriers currently include EU roaming to stay competitive, but no legal requirement. Could change. Have backup plans.

## The Bottom Line for UK

International calling from UK in 2025:

**Don't:**
- Use carrier direct international (£1-2/min is too much)
- Assume EU roaming is free (check your plan)
- Forget to check fair use caps

**Do:**
- Use browser calling for affordable international calls
- Use WhatsApp for personal calls when possible
- Check your specific carrier's EU roaming policy
- Have backup calling method

**The winning setup:**
- UK mobile plan (domestic)
- Browser calling (international)
- WhatsApp (free personal)
- Know your carrier's EU terms (travel)

**Typical monthly cost:**
- Light international caller: £15-25 total
- Moderate international caller: £20-35 total
- Heavy international caller: £30-50 total

Much cheaper than paying £1-2/minute on carrier rates.
